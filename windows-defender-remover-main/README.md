## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

#### ‚≠ï Why is the downloaded executable being flagged as a virus?

That is a false positive.

Some security apps flag this app as a virus because of the way the ".exe" files are created.

#### ‚≠ï Why is the patch not working when Windows is updated?

Windows Update includes a ```Intelligence Update``` which blocks certain actions and modifies Windows Defender/Security policies.
If the script is not working for you, check if you have the Windows Security Intelligence Update installed. If you do, disable tamper protection, and re-run the script.

#### ‚≠ï How to use the package remover without downloading the executable from the release?

Run the desired ".bat" file from cmd with PowerRun (by dragging to the executable). You must reboot for the changes to take effect.
